# Real Time Bus Tracker

In this project, we are creating real time bus tracker using live data
from MBTA in JSON file. The goal of this project is to fetch data from
an API and use it to animate a map. I implemented a function to update
MBTA Route 1 buses geolocation in real time every 15 seconds by adding
an animated marker on the map with bus id to highlight the bus routes.

[Demo](https://nandhinikarvendhan.github.io/Real-Time-Bus-Tracker/)

## How to run

1. Download or clone this repository.

2. Open index.html file in your browser.

3. Every 15 seconds bus geolocation is highlighted by marker.

## Roadmap of future improvements:

Changing the color of the marker for each bus.
Alert when there is no bus in transit.
